- normalize the many models: create/read/update in different packages
- implement logging
- normalize the .dcs .dcp extensions with the job idea of press/scan (hmm?/scan)
- implement signal handling for the asyncio of daemons
- `deciphon.hmmer_press` maybe a temporary solution? Solve this at `deciphon-core`
instead?
